          I'm a front end developer with the goal of concise, clean coding with
          user accessibility in mind.
          <br />
          <br />
          I started learning to code in 2019 with a Python Course on
          CodeCademy.com, and while I changed direction to front-end coding,
          those first lessons helped kick-start my interest in coding and the
          decision to build towards a career as a developer.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since then, I have used a variety of online resources to expand my
          knowledge and skill set, all with a focus on building projects as I
          grow.
          <br />
          <br />
          At first, I did most of my coding on the CodeCademy platform, but
          recently I have performed more coding in my GitHub repositories to
          better let others see my activity and growth. <br />
          <br />
          Moving forward, my goal is to find a company I can grow at and a team
          that creates great things. <br />
          <br />
          Whether I am creating a website, making an app, writing a new book, or
          building something with my hands, I approach every problem the same
          way; with a sense of curiosity and an excitement for the finished
          product.
