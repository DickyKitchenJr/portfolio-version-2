        <p className="aboutMeContent">
          As a software developer, I bring a unique perspective to my work that
          is informed by my experience as a Physical Therapist Assistant. Over
          my 15-year career in healthcare (2 as a PT Tech and 13 as a LPTA), I
          developed valuable skills in clear communication, attention to detail,
          and a commitment to providing high-quality care. These skills have
          translated seamlessly into my coding career, where I'm dedicated to
          creating websites and applications that make a positive impact on
          people's lives.
          <br />
          <br />
          With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I'm able
          to approach every project with a sense of curiosity and excitement,
          just as I approached every patient with a desire to help them achieve
          their goals. In addition to my technical skills, I bring a range of
          soft skills to my work, including effective verbal and written
          communication, a team-oriented mindset, problem-solving ability,
          creativity, and adaptability. I'm always eager to learn and improve,
          and I value constructive feedback as an opportunity to grow and
          develop my skills further.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether I'm working independently or collaborating with a team, I
          approach every project with an open-minded, teachable attitude and a
          commitment to delivering results that exceed expectations. I'm excited
          about the opportunity to leverage my skills and experience to make a
          positive impact in the software development space and to contribute to
          innovative, user-centered solutions for clients and users alike.

          In addition to my years of experience in health care and time I've
          taken to learn coding, I'm also a published author of 2 thriller books
          and 1 children's book, as well as a loving husband and father.
